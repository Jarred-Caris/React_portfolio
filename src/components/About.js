        <p>
          I am a future web developer in the making, currently undertaking a 6
          month intensive coding bootcamp. I have spent over 15 years in the
          customer service and sales industry and looking for a drastic career
          change. My love for technology and my creative mindset made web
          development the most logical and exciting pathway for me.
