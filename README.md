## Installation
none

## Technology
React, html, javascript, css  

## Success
I genuinely loved this project. I enjoying seeing things come to life and this one was one of the best experiences. I found most of my issues i could resolve quite quickly and was able to spend a little more time working on styling and trying new things. Im starting to get the hang of React!

## Holdbacks
I had a few little hold backs which took a little time to figure out. Getting bootstrap and React to work together took a little practice. And initially getting my buttons to go to the corresponding page took a little practice but was able to get there in the end.

## Contribution
We were given no code to begin with. Code an app was created from scratch

## Test
no testing
